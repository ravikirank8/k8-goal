Who can access the API Server is defined by the Authentication mechanisms. - Authentication
Once they gain access to the cluster, what they can do is defined by authorization mechanisms. - authorization

cluster and components communication is secured using TLS encryption. TLS encryption
What about communication between applications within the cluster? - Network policies

All user access is managed by apiserver and all of the requests goes through apiserver.
useraccounts called as service accounts

check kube-api service account --basic-auth=user.csv

=============

Symmetric Encryption
It is a secure way of encryption, but it uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data and the key has to be exchanged between the sender and the receiver, 
there is a risk of a hacker gaining access to the key and decrypting the data.

Asymmetric Encryption
Instead of using single key to encrypt and decrypt data, asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys, a private key and a public key.

Let's look at the different components within the k8s cluster and identify the various servers and clients and who talks to whom.
.key is private key
.crt is public key

etcd,kube-api and kubelet are server certificates remaing all are client certificates

==================

Generating certificates

Certificate Authority (CA)

CertificateSigningRequest (CSR)

Generate Keys
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048

Generate CSR
openssl req -new -key ca.key -subj "/CN=KUBERNETES-CA" -out ca.csr

Sign certificates
 openssl x509 -req -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt
 
 Client services only sign is different
openssl x509 -req -in admin.csr -CA ca.crt -CA key ca.key -out admin.crt

Certificate with admin privilages
$ openssl req -new -key admin.key -subj "/CN=kube-admin/O=system:masters" -out admin.csr
