Kubectl suddenly stops responding to your commands. Check it out! Someone recently modified the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml file

You are asked to investigate and fix the issue. Once you fix the issue wait for sometime for kubectl to respond. Check the logs of the ETCD container.

tip : go to original documention serach for pki(orignal certificate paths 
1)issue may cert path incorrect
check correct path is used or not example etcd-cafile search in pki docs and match the certificate
check the original path and match with missing
Use check crictl ps -a and crictl logs container-id
somegoes wrong with kubectl and pods info check kube-api and etcd and its certificates
check correct path is used or not example etcd-cafile search in pki docs and match the certificate

a)

controlplane /etc/kubernetes ➜  grep -i /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd* /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml 
    - --cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server-certificate.crt
    - --key-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
    - --peer-cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.crt
    - --peer-key-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.key
    - --peer-trusted-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
    - --trusted-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
    - mountPath: /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd
      path: /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd

controlplane /etc/kubernetes ➜  cat /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server-certificate.crt
cat: /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server-certificate.crt: No such file or directory

The kube-api server stopped again! Check it out. Inspect the kube-api server logs and identify the root cause and fix the issue.

Run crictl ps -a command to identify the kube-api server container. Run crictl logs container-id command to view the logs.

If we inspect the kube-apiserver container on the controlplane, we can see that it is frequently exiting.

root@controlplane:~# crictl ps -a | grep kube-apiserver
1fb242055cff8       529072250ccc6       About a minute ago   Exited              kube-apiserver            3                   ed2174865a416       kube-apiserver-controlplane
If we now inspect the logs of this exited container, we would see the following errors:

root@controlplane:~# crictl logs --tail=2 1fb242055cff8  
W0916 14:19:44.771920       1 clientconn.go:1331] [core] grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {127.0.0.1:2379 127.0.0.1 <nil> 0 <nil>}. Err: connection error: desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority". Reconnecting...
E0916 14:19:48.689303       1 run.go:74] "command failed" err="context deadline exceeded"
This indicates an issue with the ETCD CA certificate used by the kube-apiserver. Correct it to use the file /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt.

Once the YAML file has been saved, wait for the kube-apiserver pod to be Ready. This can take a couple of minutes.
