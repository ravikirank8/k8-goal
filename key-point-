Remove the taint on controlplane, which currently has the taint effect of NoSchedule.

Taint and Toleration in Kubernetes are mechanisms to control how pods are scheduled on nodes.

A taint is a property that can be assigned to a node, indicating that the node should not accept pods that do not tolerate the taint.(repel)

A toleration is a property that can be assigned to a pod, indicating that the pod can run on a node that has a specific taint.

The effect of taint and toleration on pods and nodes is that pods will only be scheduled on nodes that don't have taints that the pod's tolerations do not match.
This allows administrators to designate certain nodes for special use cases
(e.g. dedicated nodes for specific types of workloads), and ensures that pods are only scheduled where they are intended to run.
==================


In Kubernetes, NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, and NoExecute are taint effects that control how pods are scheduled on nodes.

NoSchedule: This taint effect indicates that pods should not be scheduled on the node, and any existing pods will be evicted 
if they do not have a matching toleration.

PreferNoSchedule: This taint effect indicates that pods should not be scheduled on the node, but if a pod with a matching toleration already exists, 
it will not be evicted.

NoExecute: This taint effect indicates that pods should not be scheduled on the node and any existing pods will be evicted if they do not have a matching toleration.
In addition, the node will not be used for new pod executions, even if the pods have matching tolerations.

Tolerations are assigned to pods, and they define the taints that a pod can tolerate. 
When a pod is created, the scheduler checks if there is a node available that does not have any taints that the pod cannot tolerate,
and if found, the pod is scheduled on that node.


=============

In Kubernetes, taints and tolerations use two comparison operations: Exists and Equal.

Exists: This comparison operator is used to check if a taint exists on a node.
If a toleration with the Exists operator is specified for a pod, the pod will be scheduled on a node with any value for that taint key, as long as the key exists.

Equal: This comparison operator is used to check if the value of a taint on a node matches the value specified in the toleration.
If a toleration with the Equal operator is specified for a pod, the pod will be scheduled on a node only if the value of the taint on the node matches the value in the toleration.

For example, if a node has a taint with key "environment" and value "production", and a pod has a toleration with key "environment", effect "NoSchedule",
and operator "Equal", the pod will only be scheduled on the node if the value of the taint is "production". 
If the toleration specifies the operator as "Exists", the pod will be scheduled on the node as long as the taint with key "environment" exists,
regardless of its value.
